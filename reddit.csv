**Prompt:** Customers who subscribe to Amazon Prime get free access to certain shows and movies. They can also buy or rent shows, as not all content is available for free to Prime customers. Additionally, they can pay to subscribe to channels such as Showtime, Starz or Paramount+, all accessible through their Amazon Prime account.

In case you are not familiar with Amazon Prime Video, the homepage typically has one large feature such as “Watch the Seahawks vs. the 49ers tomorrow!”. If you scroll past that, there are many rows of video content such as “Movies we think you’ll like”, “Trending Now”, and “Top Picks for You”. Assume that each row is either all free content, or all paid content. [Here is an example screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/PoWux79).

# Question 1: What are the benefits to Amazon of focusing on optimizing what is shown to each user on the Prime Video home page?

Potential answers:

>!(looking for pros/cons, candidate should list at least 3 good answers)!<

>!Showing the right content to the right customer on the Prime Video homepage has lots of potential benefits. It is important for Amazon to decide how to prioritize because the right prioritization could:!<

* >!**Drive engagement:** Highlighting free content ensures customers derive value from their Prime subscription.!<
* >!**Increase revenue:** Promoting paid content or paid channels can drive additional purchases or subscriptions.!<
* >!**Customer satisfaction:** Ensuring users find relevant and engaging content quickly leads to a better browsing experience.!<
* >!**Content discovery:** Showcasing a mix of content encourages customers to explore beyond free offerings.!<
* >!**But keep in mind potential challenges:** Overemphasis on paid content may alienate customers who want free content. They could think “I’m paying for Prime to get access to free content, why is Amazon pushing all this paid content”!<

# Question 2: What key considerations should Amazon take into account when deciding how to prioritize content types on the Prime Video homepage?

Potential answers:

>!(Again the candidate should list at least 3 good answers)!<

* >!**Free vs. paid balance:** Ensure users see value in their Prime subscription while exposing them to paid options. This is a delicate balance - Amazon wants to upsell customers on paid content without increasing Prime subscription churn. Keep in mind that paid content is usually newer and more in demand (e.g. new releases)!<
* >!**User engagement:** Consider the user’s watch history and preferences (e.g., genres, actors, shows vs. movies).!<
* >!**Revenue impact:** Assess how prominently displaying paid content or channels influences rental, purchase, and subscription revenue.!<
* >!**Content availability:** Prioritize content that is currently trending, newly released, or exclusive to Amazon Prime Video.!<
* >!**Geo and licensing restrictions:** Adapt recommendations based on the content available in the user’s region.!<

# Question 3: Let’s say you hypothesize that prioritizing free Prime content will increase user engagement. How would you measure whether this hypothesis is true?

Potential answer:

>!I would design an experiment where the treatment is that free Prime content is prioritized on row one of the homepage. The control group will see whatever the existing strategy is for row one (it would be fair for the candidate to ask what the existing strategy is. If asked, respond that the current strategy is to equally prioritize free and paid content in row one).!<

>!To measure whether prioritizing free Prime content in row one would increase user engagement, I would use the following metrics:!<

* >!**Primary metric:** Average hours watched per user per week.!<
* >!**Secondary metrics:** Click-through rate (CTR) on row one.!<
* >!**Guardrail metric:** Revenue from paid content and channels!<

# Question 4: How would you design an A/B test to evaluate which prioritization strategy is most effective? Be detailed about the experiment design.

Potential answer:

>!1. Clearly State the Hypothesis:!<

>!Prioritizing free Prime content on the homepage will increase engagement (e.g., hours watched) compared to equal prioritization of paid content and free content because free content is perceived as an immediate value of the Prime subscription, reducing friction of watching and encouraging users to explore and watch content without additional costs or decisions.!<

>!2. Success Metrics:!<

* >!Primary Metric: Average hours watched per user per week.!<
* >!Secondary Metric: Click-through rate (CTR) on row one.!<

>!3. Guardrail Metrics:!<

* >!Revenue from paid content and channels, per user: Ensure prioritizing free content does not drastically reduce purchases or subscriptions.!<
   * >!Numerator: Total revenue generated from each experiment group from paid rentals, purchases, and channel subscriptions during the experiment.!<
   * >!Denominator: Total number of users in the experiment group.!<
* >!Bounce rate: Ensure the experiment does not unintentionally make the homepage less engaging overall.!<
   * >!Numerator: Number of users who log in to Prime Video but leave without clicking on or interacting with any content.!<
   * >!Denominator: Total number of users who log in to Prime Video, per experiment group!<
* >!Churn rate: Monitor for any long-term negative impact on overall customer retention.!<
   * >!Numerator: Number of Prime members who cancel their subscription during the experiment!<
   * >!Denominator: Total number of Prime members in the experiment.!<

>!4. Tracking Metrics:!<

* >!CTR on free, paid, and channel-specific recommendations. This will help us evaluate how well users respond to different types of content being highlighted.!<
   * >!Numerator: Number of clicks on free/paid/channel content cards on the homepage.!<
   * >!Denominator: Total number of impressions of free/paid/channel content cards on the homepage.!<
* >!Adoption rate of paid channels (percentage of users subscribing to a promoted channel).!<

>!5. Randomization:!<

* >!Randomization Unit: Users (Prime subscribers).!<
* >!Why this will work: User-level randomization ensures independent exposure to different homepage designs without contamination from other users.!<
* >!Point of Incorporation to the experiment: Users are assigned to treatment (free content prioritized) or control (equal prioritization of free and paid content) upon logging in to Prime Video, or landing on the Prime Video homepage if they are already logged in.!<
* >!Randomization Strategy: Assign users to treatment or control groups in a 50/50 split.!<

>!6. Statistical Test to Analyze Metrics:!<

* >!For continuous metrics (e.g., hours watched): t-test!<
* >!For proportions (e.g., CTR): Z-test of proportions!<
* >!Also, using regression is an appropriate answer, as long as they state what the dependent and independent variables are.!<
* >!Bonus points if candidate mentions CUPED for variance reduction, but not necessary!<

>!7. Power Analysis:!<

* >!Candidate should mention conducting a power analysis to estimate the required sample size and experiment duration. Don’t have to go too deep into this, but candidate should at least mention these key components of power analysis:!<
   * >!Alpha (e.g. 0.05), power (e.g. 0.8), MDE (minimum detectable effect) and how they would decide the MDE (e.g. prior experiments, discuss with stakeholders), and variance in the metrics!<
   * >!Do not have to discuss the formulas for calculating sample size!<

# Question 5: Suppose the new prioritization strategy won the experiment, and is fully launched. Leadership wants a dashboard to monitor its performance. What metrics would you include in this dashboard?

Potential answers:

* >!**Engagement metrics:**!<
   * >!Average hours watched per user per week.!<
   * >!CTR on homepage recommendations (broken down by free, paid, and channel content).!<
   * >!CTR on by row!<
* >!**Revenue metrics:**!<
   * >!Revenue from paid content rentals and purchases.!<
   * >!Subscriptions to paid channels.!<
* >!**Retention metrics:**!<
   * >!Weekly active users (WAU).!<
   * >!Monthly active users (MAU).!<
   * >!Churn rate of Prime subscribers.!<
* >!**Operational metrics:**!<
   * >!Latency or errors in the recommendation algorithm.!<
   * >!User satisfaction scores (e.g., via feedback or surveys).!<",productanalyst9,t2_4dj7jy40,1737942221.0,/r/datascience/comments/1iawkau/free_product_analytics_product_data_scientist/,95,0.93,7,public

I’ve been using a single Jupyter Notebook for quite some time, and it’s evolved into a massive file that contains everything from data loading to final analysis. My typical process starts with importing data, cleaning it up, and saving the results for reuse in pickle files. When I revisit the notebook, I load these intermediate files and build on them with transformations, followed by exploratory analysis, visualizations, and insights.

While this workflow gets the job done, it’s becoming increasingly chaotic. Some parts are clearly meant to be reusable steps, while others are just me testing ideas or exploring possibilities. It all lives in one place, which is convenient in some ways but a headache in others. I often wonder if there’s a better way to organize this while keeping the flexibility that makes Jupyter such a great tool for exploration.

DML researchers want to help me out here?,DML researchers want to help me out here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i90imp/dml_researchers_want_to_help_me_out_here/,"

Hey guys, I’m a MS statistician by background who has been doing my masters thesis in DML for about 6 months now. 

One of the things that I have a question about is, does the functional form of the propensity and outcome model really not matter that much? 

My advisor isn’t trained in this either, but we have just been exploring by fitting different models to the propensity and outcome model. 

What we have noticed is no matter you use xgboost, lasso, or random forests, the ATE estimate is damn close to the truth most of the time, and any bias is like not that much.

So I hate to say that my work thus far feels anti-climactic, but it feels kinda weird to done all this work to then just realize, ah well it seems the type of ML model doesn’t really impact the results.

In statistics I have been trained to just think about the functional form of the model and how it impacts predictive accuracy. 

But what I’m finding is in the case of causality, none of that even matters.


I guess I’m kinda wondering if I’m on the right track here

My stack is currently Python, Julia, R… and my field of interest is numerical computing, OpenMP, MPI and GPU parallel computing (down the line)

I’m curious as to how best to align my current work with high level languages with my interest in lower level languages. 

If I were deciding based on work alone, Fortran will be the best language for me to learn as there’s a lot of legacy code we’d have to port in the next years. 

However, I’d like to develop in a language that’ll complement the skill set of a DS.

My current view is Julia, C and Fortran. However, I’m not completely sure of how useful these are outside of my very-specific field. 

Are there any other DS that have gone through this? How did you decide? What would you recommend? What factors did you consider.",NoteClassic,t2_a3htihtu,1737549714.0,/r/datascience/comments/1i7a8e0/ds_interested_in_lower_level_languages/,10,0.75,19,public
Is this a normal data analyst experience? Expectations for new data analysts in the field,Is this a normal data analyst experience? Expectations for new data analysts in the field,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i6qcch/is_this_a_normal_data_analyst_experience/,"I am a data analyst for a corporate company, this is my first year in a role like this and it has been a year. My manager is concerned that I have holes in my understanding about the company, but I feel like it is the lack of training and resources. I've never struggled so much in a role before, I previously worked in sales/sales admin for 5 years at a scientific company.

When I was interviewed, I explained that I had no experience with pivot tables or vlookup. It was my understanding from the interview that they were looking for someone to mentor, and I was hired on for having a great attitude. During onboarding, I was given pretty surface level material to review and met maybe a handful of times with others on the teams on building basic reports. I've had to do a lot of studying on my own time. During the year though, I have continued to struggle on the reporting aspect of my job and feel the relationship strains at work because of it. I am proud to say that I have been practicing excel files online with sample data at home for months and can successfully create files on my own. I've asked to shadow and practice files at home, but I was told to just learn more about the company and ask more questions. This is the kind of scenario I keep running into at my current job:

Ex: A few weeks ago, I was tasked to create a report. I was told to look at a few automated reports and essentially play around/figure it out. I was trained on two automated reports, but had not been trained on the others. My team was a bit annoyed with my confusion on which report I should use and that I should know based on the data. They gave me a suggestion on what report to try. I played around with the data on my own and got like 70% with the data I had. I was told yesterday that they decided to pull data elsewhere (because it would cover everything they wanted on the report more easily)  from a space I don't have access to and haven't been trained on.

I'm working on a little personal project, quantifying what technologies are most asked for in Data Science JDs. Really I'm more using it to work on my Python chops. I'm hitting a slightly perplexing error and I think ChatGPT has taken me as far as it possibly can on this one. 

When I attempt to crawl my spider I get this error:

Previously the code was attempting to import Injectable from scrap\_poet until I eventually inspected the package and saw that Injectable doesn't exist. So I attempted to avoid using that entirely and omitted all references to Injectable in my code. Yet I'm still getting this error. Any thoughts?

Analyzing changes to gravel height along a road,Analyzing changes to gravel height along a road,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i6qa6u/analyzing_changes_to_gravel_height_along_a_road/,"I’m working with a dataset that measures the height of gravel along a 50 km stretch of road at 10-meter intervals.

Baseline height: The original height of the gravel.

New height: A more recent measurement showing how the gravel has decreased over time.

This gives me the difference in height at various points along the road. I’d like to model this data to understand and predict gravel depletion. 

Here’s what I’m considering:Identifying trends or patterns in gravel loss (e.g., areas with more significant depletion).

Using interpolation to estimate gravel heights at points where measurements are missing.

Exploring possible environmental factors that could influence depletion (e.g., road curvature, slope, or proximity to towns).

However, I’m not entirely sure how to approach this analysis. Some questions I have:

What are the best methods to visualize and analyze this type of spatial data?

Are there statistical or machine learning models particularly suited for this?

Should I Try to postpone my FAANG Interview?,Should I Try to postpone my FAANG Interview?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i5576y/should_i_try_to_postpone_my_faang_interview/,"So I got contacted by a FAANG Recruiter for a Data Scientist Role I applied for a month and a half ago. But as I have started to prep, I realize I am not ready and need 1 to 2 months before I would be able to do well on all the technical interviews (there are 4 of them). My SQL is rusty because I have been using Pyspark so much that I didn't really need to do medium to hard SQL queries at work (We're also not allowed in most cases since SQL is slower). So I would just do everything in Pyspark. But now, as I start practicing my SQL I realize it's very basic, and it's going to take some time before I can get it on the level my pyspark is at.

I've noticed that I feel like there is no chance of me performing well enough on this interview, and it sucks because the recruiter said that the hiring manager was looking at my resume and really wants to interview me as soon as possible since he thinks I have strong experience for the role (They made me bypass the phone screens because of it). I have no doubt I would be able to do the role, but interviews are another beast. According to the prep guide, my Stats, ML Theory, SQL, and Python all have to be perfect. Since I joined my current company as an intern, I didn't have to do as many in-depth technicals as I have to do here. I've interviewed at a couple other big companies last year and didn't make it to the final round for one simply because I needed more time to prepare. The FAANG recruiter wants me to do the first 2 interviews within the next two weeks, and I'm worried about what it would do to my confidence if I failed this interview since this is pretty much my dream Data Scientist role. My mind is already telling me just to make the best of this and use it as a learning experience, but another part of me is wondering if I should just cancel it altogether or try to delay it as much as possible. I have a mock interview with a Company Data Scientist they set up for me in a few days, but part of me feels defeated already and it sucks...

I honestly am not sure what to do as I need a lot more time.

I had a recruiter (heavy Indian accent) call/email me with an interesting proposition. They work for the candidate rather than the company. If they place you in a job within 45 days they ask for 9% of your first year's salary.

They claim their value add is in a couple of things. First they promise that they have advanced ATS software that will help tweak professional qualifications. Second, they say they will apply to approximately 50 JDs per day (I am skeptical this many relevant jobs are even being posted).

I have never had luck with Indian recruiters before but I have had good experiences professionally in offshoring some repetitive tasks for cheap. This process sounds like it fits the bill.

Currently, the software is hosted from my GitHub, and it is still undergoing developments (i.e., for computing inference for point-estinates/user friendliness).

mlsynth implements the following methods: [Augmented Difference-in-Differences](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.1406), CLUSTERSCM, [Debiased Convex Regression](https://doi.org/10.1287/inte.2023.0028)  (undocumented at present), the [Factor Model Approach](https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437221137533), [Forward Difference-in-Differences](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.1406), [Forward Selected Panel Data Approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.04.009), the [L1PDA](https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.1230), the [L2-relaxation PDA](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11670.97609), [Principal Component Regression](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.1928513), [Robust PCA Synthetic Control](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/4984), [Synthetic Control Method (Vanilla SCM)](https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746), [Two Step Synthetic Control](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4878)  and finally the two newest methods which are not yet fully documented, [Proximal Inference-SCM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13935) and [Proximal Inference with Surrogates-SCM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09527)  

While each method has their own options (e.g., Bayesian or not, l2 relaxer versus L1), all methods have a common syntax which allows us to switch seamlessly between methods without needing to switch softwares or learn a new syntax for a different library/command. It also brings forth methods which either had no public documentation yet, or were written mostly for/in MATLAB.

The documentation that currently exists explains installation as well as the basic methodology of each method. I also provide worked examples from the academic literature to serve as a reference point for how one may use the code to estimate causal effects.

So, to anybody who uses Python and causal methods on a regular basis, this is an option that may suit your needs better than standard techniques.",turingincarnate,t2_amhd0mtb,1737052050.0,/r/datascience/comments/1i2vmuv/introducing_mlsynth/,22,0.89,11,public

I like the attitude, but I tried myself a few years ago and got burned. So I wanna share my experience. 
   
I am a Data Scientist and tried to start freelancing with just one year job experience in 2017. Did the usual stuff. Set up an Upwork profile, applied to jobs at nights and during weekends and waited for a reply. 
Crickets. I **applied to 11 jobs** and didn't get any. Looking back at that experience I see a few mistakes
1 I didn't have a portfolio of projects that matched the jobs I applied to. 
2 I only used Upwork, without leveraging LInkedIn, Catalant, Fiverr and others. 
3 I gave up too early. Just 11 applications over one month is not enough. I recommend applying to 20-30 jobs per week if possible.
4 I set an unreasonable hourly rate. I set my hourly rate same as my daily job, Freelancing is a market where you are the product. When there is no demand for you (because nobody knows you) it's a smart move to set the price low. Once demand picks up, increase the price accordingly. 

Overall, I think experience is not the number one factor that a client looks for when hiring a freelancer. It's way more important to give the client confidence that you can do the job. So you should always work with that goal in mind, from the way you build your profile, to all the communication with your client. 
Last bit of advice. I found success in my local market at first. In Italy there is not many Data professionals that are also freelancers, and that helped me. People like to work with familiar faces and speaking the same language, sharing the same culture, goes a long way building confidence.

Lately ive been kinda feeling that it would be really nice to have something of my own to work one involving analytics. Working for a company is great experience, but part of me would really like to have a business that I own where I help small businesses who have data make sense of it with low hanging fruit solutions.

Just a thought, but I’ve always thought of some sort of consultancy where clients are some sort of local business that collects data but doesn’t use it effectively or does not have the expertise on how to turn their data into insights that can be used. 

For example, suppose you had three clients:

1. Local gyms which have lots of membership data - my consultancy could offer services to measure engagement, etc and use demographic information to further understand gym goers - don’t know what “action” they could take but a thought 

2. Local shop has expenses they track and right now it’s all over the place. A dashboard that can help them view everything in one place

Something where, it’s tasks which are trivial for the average data scientist, but generate a lot of value for local businesses.

But maybe you can go deeper? I’m not sure how genAI works and haven’t played around with like any of these tools, but I’ve thought of ways these can be incorporated too.

Idk, I just find working in the industry sole draining and I just want to be able to have something that I can call my own, work on my own schedule, and it lead to a lot more revenue than working for a company. 

If anyone has any thoughts on what they have done, or how they have tried to do something, please let me know. Ideally I’d try and start this after 3-4 years of experience where I’ve built some niche industry experience.

WASM-powered codespaces for Python notebooks on GitHub,WASM-powered codespaces for Python notebooks on GitHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i275yh/wasmpowered_codespaces_for_python_notebooks_on/,"During a hackweek, we built this project that allows you to run [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) and Jupyter notebooks directly from GitHub in a Wasm-powered, codespace-like environment. What makes this powerful is that we mount the GitHub repository's contents as a filesystem in the notebook, making it really easy to share notebooks with data.

**All you need to do is prepend** [`https://marimo.app`](https://marimo.app) **to any Python notebook on GitHub.** Some examples:

* Jupyter Notebook: [https://marimo.app/github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandb...](https://marimo.app/github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/02.08-Sorting.ipynb)

Jupyter notebooks are automatically converted into marimo notebooks using basic static analysis and source code transformations. Our conversion logic assumes the notebook was meant to be run top-down, which is usually but not always true \[2\]. It can convert many notebooks, but there are still some edge cases.

We implemented the filesystem mount using our own FUSE-like adapter that links the GitHub repository’s contents to the Python filesystem, leveraging Emscripten’s filesystem API. The file tree is loaded on startup to avoid waterfall requests when reading many directories deep, but loading the file contents is lazy. For example, when you write Python that looks like

    with open(""./data/cars.csv"") as f:
        print(f.read())
    
    # or
    
    import pandas as pd
    pd.read_csv(""./data/cars.csv"")

behind the scenes, you make a request \[3\] to *https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/main/data/cars.csv*

\[3\] We technically proxy it through the playground [https://marimo.app](https://marimo.app) to fix CORS issues and GitHub rate-limiting.

**Why is this useful?**

Vieiwng notebooks on GitHub pages is limiting. They don't allow external css or scripts so charts and advanced widgets can fail. They also aren't itneractive so you can't tweek a value or pan/zoom a chart.

"Advanced Imputation Techniques for Correlated Time Series: Insights and Experiences?

","Advanced Imputation Techniques for Correlated Time Series: Insights and Experiences?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i29a6d/advanced_imputation_techniques_for_correlated/,"**Advanced Imputation Techniques for Correlated Time Series: Insights and Experiences?**

Hi everyone,

I’m looking to spark a discussion about **advanced imputation techniques** for datasets with multiple distinct but correlated time series. Imagine a dataset like **energy consumption** or **sales data**, where hundreds of stores or buildings are measured separately. The granularity might be hourly or daily, with varying levels of data completeness across the time series.

Here’s the challenge:

1. Some buildings/stores have **complete or nearly complete data** with only a few missing values. These are straightforward to impute using standard techniques.
2. Others have **partial data**, with gaps ranging from days to months.
3. Finally, there are buildings with **100% missing values** for the target variable across the entire time frame, leaving us reliant on correlated data and features.

The time series show **clear seasonal patterns** (weekly, annual) and dependencies on external factors like weather, customer counts, or building size. While these features are available for all buildings—including those with no target data—the features alone are insufficient to accurately predict the target. Correlations between the time series range from moderate (\~0.3) to very high (\~0.9), making the data situation highly heterogeneous.

# My Current Approach:

For stores/buildings with **few or no data points**, I’m considering an approach that involves:

1. **Using Correlated Stores**: Identify stores with high correlations based on available data (e.g., monthly aggregates). These could serve as a foundation for imputing the missing time series.
2. **Reconciling to Monthly Totals**: If we know the **monthly sums** of the target for stores with missing hourly/daily data, we could constrain the imputed time series to match these totals. For example, adjust the imputed hourly/daily values so that their sum equals the known monthly figure.
3. **Incorporating Known Features**: For stores with missing target data, use additional features (e.g., holidays, temperature, building size, or operational hours) to refine the imputed time series. For example, if a store was closed on a Monday due to repairs or a holiday, the imputation should respect this and redistribute values accordingly.

# Why Just Using Correlated Stores Isn’t Enough:

While using highly correlated stores for imputation seems like a natural approach, it has limitations. For instance:

* A store might be closed on certain days (e.g., repairs or holidays), resulting in zero or drastically reduced energy consumption. Simply copying or scaling values from correlated stores won’t account for this.
* The known features for the missing store (e.g., building size, operational hours, or customer counts) might differ significantly from those of the correlated stores, leading to biased imputations.
* Seasonal patterns (e.g., weekends vs. weekdays) may vary slightly between stores due to operational differences.

# Open Questions:

* **Feature Integration**: How can we better incorporate the available features of stores with 100% missing values into the imputation process while respecting known totals (e.g., monthly sums)?
* **Handling Correlation-Based Imputation**: Are there specific techniques or algorithms that work well for leveraging correlations between time series for imputation?
* **Practical Adjustments**: When reconciling imputed values to match known totals, what methods work best for redistributing values while preserving the overall seasonal and temporal patterns?

From my perspective, this approach seems sensible, but I’m curious about others' experiences with similar problems or opinions on why this might—or might not—work in practice. If you’ve dealt with imputation in datasets with heterogeneous time series and varying levels of completeness, I’d love to hear your insights!

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and ideas!

E-values: A modern alternative to p-values,E-values: A modern alternative to p-values,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i1bjhi/evalues_a_modern_alternative_to_pvalues/,"In many modern applications - A/B testing, clinical trials, quality monitoring - we need to analyze data as it arrives. Traditional statistical tools weren't designed with this sequential analysis in mind, which has led to the development of new approaches.

E-values are one such tool, specifically designed for sequential testing. They provide a natural way to measure evidence that accumulates over time. An e-value of 20 represents 20-to-1 evidence against your null hypothesis - a direct and intuitive interpretation. They're particularly useful when you need to:

- Monitor results in real-time
- Add more samples to ongoing experiments
- Combine evidence from multiple analyses
- Make decisions based on continuous data streams

While p-values remain valuable for fixed-sample scenarios, e-values offer complementary strengths for sequential analysis. They're increasingly used in tech companies for A/B testing and in clinical trials for interim analyses.

If you work with sequential data or continuous monitoring, e-values might be a useful addition to your statistical toolkit. Happy to discuss specific applications or mathematical details in the comments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Really, the kind of stuff would be talking about new tools/products that might be of use, tips and tricks, some re-learning of knowledge you might have learned 10+ years ago, deep dives of random but pertinent topics, or someone that consistently puts out unique visualizations and how to recreate them.

Feeling stuck in my career. Please help,Feeling stuck in my career. Please help,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hyte5x/feeling_stuck_in_my_career_please_help/,"I'm in a weird position, where I feel like I'm stuck in my career. I really enjoy mathematics, ML/AI, implemented a lot of algorithms from scratch in C, developed new models for business purposes, presented at some internal/small conferences, and developed entire ML infrastructures for startups, but having no real opportunities to grow more.

At the moment I'm making over 100k$ working remotely from eastern Europe for a FAANG in the US (they have an office here, but my entire data science team is based in the US and I'm working on the same things as them).

When applying to companies in the US/UK I'm receiving zero callbacks (willing to relocate), although companies from the same areas are reaching out with remote offers of \~100k$/year. Those don't have the benefits of my current company, and are not attractive opportunities. I'm looking to relocate and get 200k$+. Current internal transfers to the US are closed, as they are looking to expand in east Europe. I've also asked for more difficult projects, but those are only available for US, not for my region.

The projects that are open to me at the moment offer zero satisfaction and I want to solve more complex problems and continue to expand my skills, but I'm stuck for the only thing that my studies are in eastern Europe and that I don't hold a PhD, even though I've already worked on novel models in industry, and speaking with friends and colleagues that hold a PhD, my skills are on par.

I'm at a point where I feel like skills and projects don't mean absolutely anything, and the only thing that has any weight for getting a job are diplomas and people you know... Maybe I'm exaggerating, but from all of my experiences I'm starting to feel like people from my region without studies abroad are seen only as cheap labor that should never be given the chance to work on real problems and be paid accordingly (a shitty company directly told me that, while another told me explicitly that my skills don't matter and they're only offering bad projects with bad pay in my region). It's like, there's a limit to the level of difficulty I can work on and the pay I can receive, regardless of how much I outcompete others...

At the moment, I'm working on a side research project that I'll be sending to some top tier conferences, and then try getting a PhD in the west... but that will take years, and if I already have the skills it's so frustrating to be stuck for so long just for a diploma and a title...

Or maybe my skills are really not on par, and I'm only good compared to the people in my region? Here's my resume if anyone would be willing to offer me some feedback.",SemperZero,t2_8yzemir1,1736592284.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hyte5x/feeling_stuck_in_my_career_please_help/,60,0.87,35,public

I'm currently working in different architectures for video classification as well as using large multimodal models to classify video. They want to show how no other model works on our own data (obviously) and how recent architectures are not as good as our own super secret model (videoMAE finetunned on our data...). I'm okay with faking results/showing results that cannot be compared fairly. I mean I'm not but if that's what they want to do then fine, doesn't really involve more work for me.

Now what pisses me off is that now I need to come up with a way to get an accuracy per class in a multilabel classification setting based solely on precision and recall per class because different models were evaluated by different people at different times and I really only have those 2 metrics per class - precision and recall. I don't even know if this is possible, it feels like it isn't, and is an overall dumb metric for our use case. All because investors only know the word ""accuracy""....

Would it not be enough to say: ""This is the F1 score for our most important classes, and as you can see, none of the other models or architectures we've tried are as good as our best model...

Edit - thank you all for the congratulations and I’m sorry I can’t respond to DMs. Here are answers to some common questions. 

1. The technical coding challenge was only SQL. Frankly in my 8 years of analytics, none of my peers use Python regularly unless their role is to automate or data engineering. You’re better off mastering SQL by using leetcode and DataLemur

2. Interviews at all the FAANGs are similar. Call with HR rep, first round is with 1 person and might be technical. Then a final round with a bunch of individual interviews on the same day. Most of the questions will be STAR format. 

3. As for my skillsets, I advertise myself as someone who can build strategy, project manage, and can do deep dive analyses. I’m never going to compete against the recent grads and experts in ML/LLM/AI on technical skills, that’s just an endless grind to stay at the top.

Has anyone had occasions where the interviewer was wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hx305z/i_was_penalized_in_a_ds_interview_for_answering/,"Hi,

I underwent a technical interview for a DS role at a company. The company was nice enough to provide feedback. This reason was not only reason I was rejected, but I wanted to share because it was very surprising to me. 

They said I aced the programming. However, hey gave me feedback that my statistics performance was mixed. I was surprised. The question was what type of model would I use for an A/B test with time spent on an app as an outcome. I suspect many would use a t-test but I believe that would be inappropriate since time is a skewed outcome, with only positive values, so a t-test would not fit the data well (i.e., Gaussian outcome). I suggested a log-normal or log-gamma generalized linear model instead.

  
I later received feedback that I was penalized for suggesting a linear model for the A/B test. However, a linear model with a binary predictor *is equivalent to a t-test*. I don't want to be arrogant or presumptuous that I think the interviewer is wrong and I am right, but I am struggling to have any other interpretation than the interviewer did not realize a linear model with a binary predictor is equivalent to a t-test.

Question on quasi-experimental approach for product feature change measurement,Question on quasi-experimental approach for product feature change measurement,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hxnq3t/question_on_quasiexperimental_approach_for/,"I work in ecommerce analytics and my team runs dozens of traditional, ""clean"" online A/B tests each year. That said, I'm far from an expert in the domain - I'm still working through a part-time master's degree and I've only been doing experimentation (without any real training) for the last 2.5 years. 

One of my product partners wants to run a learning test to help with user flow optimization. But because of some engineering architecture limitations, we can't do a normal experiment. Here are some details:

* Desired outcome is to understand the impact of removing the (outdated) new user onboarding flow in our app. 
* Proposed approach is to release a new app version without the onboarding flow and compare certain engagement, purchase, and retention outcomes.
* ""Control"" group: users in the previous app version who did experience the new user flow
* ""Treatment"" group: users in the new app version who *would have* gotten the new user flow had it not been removed

One major thing throwing me off is how to handle the shifted time series; the 4 weeks of data I'll look at for each group will be different time periods. Another thing is the lack of randomization, but that can't be helped.

Given these parameters, curious what might be the best way to approach this type of ""test""? My initial thought was to use difference-in-difference but I don't think it applies given the specific lack of 'before' for each group.

The company I am at uses DBT extensively to transform data. And I mean very extensively. 

The last company I was at the data scientist did not use DBT or any sort of feature store. We just hit the raw data and write sql for our project.

The argument for our extensive feature store seems to be that it allows for reusability of complex logic across projects. And yes, this is occasionally true. But it is just as often true that there is a Table that is used for exactly one project. 

Now that I'm starting to get comfortable with the company, I'm starting to see the crack in all of this; complex tables built on top of complex tables built in to of complex tables built on raw data. Leakage and ambiguity everywhere. Onboarding is a beast. 

I understand there are times when it might be computationally important to pre-compute some calculation when doing real-time inference. But this is, in most cases, the exception, not the rule. Most models can be run on a schedule. 

TLDR; The amount of infrastructure, abstraction, and systems in place to make it so I don't have to copy and paste a few dozen lines of SQL is n or even close to a net positive. It's a huge drag.

How do you get started? How much time does it take? How to get your first project? How to build your brand?

If you do it with your current job how much time does it take? Did you take permission from your manager about this?

Other than freelancing are there better options to make additional income?

First, I'd like to thank everyone for your immense help on my last question.

With your suggestions, I've been putting in lots of time and think I'm solidly on the right path to being proficient after just a few days. Just need to keep hammering on different projects. 

At any rate, while hammering away at Python I figure it would be beneficial to try and acquaint myself with another technology so as to broaden my resume and the pool of applicable JDs. My criteria for deciding on what to go with is essentially: 

1. Has as broad of an appeal as possible, particularly for higher paying gigs
2. Isn't a total B to pick up and I can plausibly claim it as within my skillset within a month or two if I'm diligent about learning it

If they are leveraging a model, are they simply using an API to interact with it, or are they actually fine-tuning those models with new data these companies collected for their specific use case?

What schema or data model are you using for your LLM / RAG prototyping?,What schema or data model are you using for your LLM / RAG prototyping?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1huoyaf/what_schema_or_data_model_are_you_using_for_your/,"How are you organizing your data for your RAG applications? I've searched all over and have found tons of tutorials about how the tech stack works, but very little about how the data is actually stored. I don't want to just create an application that can give an answer, I want something I can use to evaluate my progress as I improve my prompts and retrievals.

This is the kind of stuff that I think needs to be stored:

* Prompt templates (i.e., versioning my prompts)
* Final inputs to and outputs from the LLM provider (and associated metadata)
* Chunks of all my documents to be used in RAG
* The chunks that were retrieved for a given prompt, so that I can evaluate the performance of the retrieval step
* Conversations (or chains?) for when there might be multiple requests sent to an LLM for a given ""question""
* Experiments. This is for the purposes of evaluation. It would associate an experiment ID with a series of inputs/outputs for an evaluation set of questions.

I can't be the first person to hit this issue.

Firstly, why do you think this is occurring? I've seen a lot of people mention the H-1B visa is a key issue surrounding this though I personally haven't a clue.

Secondly, is there a vast difference in the UK and USA job markets surrounding data science roles and is the market just as bad in the UK as it is in the USA?

Thirdly, are these CS graduates who are unable to get tech jobs migrating to more DS-centred jobs? This will obviously saturate the DS job market significantly.

I’m currently a data manager in a school but my job is mostly just MIS upkeep, data returns and using very basic built in analytics tools to view data. 

I am currently doing a MSc in Data Science and will probably be looking for a career step up upon completion but given the state of the market at the moment I am very aware that I need to be making the most of my current position and getting as much valuable experience as possible (my work are very flexible and they would support me by supplying any data I need). 

I have looked online and apparently there are jobs as data scientists within schools but there are so many prebuilt analytics tools and government performance measures for things like student progress that I am not sure there is any value in trying to build a tool that predicts student performance etc. 

Does anyone work as a data scientist in a school/ chain of schools? If so, what does your job usually entail?

I am curious to learn how folks view themselves and the various titles in this field. Assuming Data Science is the umbrella that encompasses computer science, machine learning, statistics, maths, etc., and there is a spectrum of roles within this field, how would you self-identify? The rules are:

1. It doesn't have to be your actual title from your employer or degree major.
2. It doesn't have to be a formally known identity. For example, you can identify as a ""number cruncher"", a ""tableau manager"", a ""deep learning developer"", make up your own, or just use a formal identity, such as ""Data Scientist"" or ""Machine Learning Engineer"".
3. You have to also add your justification. i.e. why do you believe such identity justly represents you/your role?
4. It should be self-explainable, technical, maturely and reasonably justified. So avoid the likes of ""Ninja"", ""Unicorn"", ""Guru"", unless you can maturely make a compelling argument.
5. You must be open to criticism and being challenged. Other redditors are not compelled to agree with your self-identity.

My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hp7pim/my_data_science_manifesto_from_a_self_taught_data/,"**Background**

I’m a self-taught data scientist, with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist. I’m more math minded than the average person, but I’m not special. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and have worked alongside 6 data scientists, 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters. Despite being probably, the 6th out of 7 in natural ability, I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group.


**Gatekeeping**

Every day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of “what do I need to know to get started in ML/DS?” The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master. As someone who’s been on both sides, this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry. I don’t think you can be bad at math and have no pre-requisite knowledge, and be successful, but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated. Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity.



As a mechanical engineering student, I had at least 3 calculus courses, a linear algebra course, and a probability course, but it was 10+ years before I attempted to become a DS, and I didn’t remember much at all. This sub, and others like it, made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist. 



When I started my journey, I would take coding, calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc. courses. I’d take a course, do OK in it, and move onto the next thing. However, eventually I’d get defeated because I realized I couldn’t remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior. It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.


**What you actually need**

The reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.


For calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.



For stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.



For linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to ‘read’ it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.



For probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.



You don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.



You don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.



Of all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. 



By far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to ""frame"" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like ""should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?"" or “which of these algorithms will perform best?”. The answer should usually be, ""I don't know, try it, measure it, and see"". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   



Despite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. That’s what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.



The reason I’m near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies’ data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. I’ve also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. I’d have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. I’m also just aware of more ‘tips and tricks’ than anyone else.  



Good domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. 


**Advice for those self taught**


I’ve been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.



I taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.


The first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. 



My boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. 

  

Eventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. 



Once I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didn’t know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.



After 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.



I'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.


**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendy’s.

**Edit:** I’m not saying to never go deeper into things, I’m literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.


I thought it went without saying, but I’m not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.

**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic",irndk10,t2_3m3r0,1735511285.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hp7pim/my_data_science_manifesto_from_a_self_taught_data/,1989,0.96,168,public

* Looking for any seasoned perspective/advice on the situation to help anchor me since I'm in a bit of a doom spiral. 



I am looking for some career advice. I don't want to write a novel about my journey to this point, but it was a hell of a lot of work. A snippet of my relevant work experience is I worked at various tech startups doing Data Analyst/Engineering work before I found my way to DS. I graduated with my MS in Data Science back in 2021, and I landed a job at a medium/large global business in the retail space. To my surprise, it was the common meme situation where they had no infrastructure put in place for DS work, and on top of that, a former IBM DS had built a Python ""application"" being used by an internal team that was barely hanging on.

**Year 1** 

My boss asked if I'd be able to modernize the application, and since I have a bit of a programming background, I told them I'd be happy to do that to get my feet wet with the org. I am going to way oversimplify the work I did for the sake of time. The important part is this project took around 6 months as the org had everything on-prem, so I had to go through approvals to get the more ""modern"" tech. I refactored a large portion of it, containerized it, and deployed it via an OpenShift (RedHat's Kubernetes product) cluster. The bulk of the program was a massive Jupyter Notebook (5000 lines of code with some custom-built math libraries) that an analyst would execute each cell after a request was made. This notebook housed all the business logic, so I just wrapped all that up to be executed automatically when the internal team interacted with the new app. By the end of it, I had a firm grasp on various business processes and was already talking to my boss about possibilities. Additionally, I found out that I was the only ""Data Scientist"" on staff, and I was a little bummed because I had chosen to work for a larger org in hopes of getting some sort of mentor/learn-by-osmosis going on. However, since my background is in startups I wasn't overly concerned because I knew I could utilize this environment to grow by trailblazing.

The conversation then shifted to the logic in the notebook, and the fact that no one really knew what was happening inside it. This notebook was driving a fairly important piece of the business by analyzing various datapoints, applying business rules, and spitting out results to be used day to day. They asked if I could dissect it, and I readily agreed – really wish LLMs were as commercialized as they are now. I spent the next 2-3 months working out bugs in the newly deployed app, and flow charting out all the business logic inside the notebook into nice Confluence pages. It was fairly spaghettified, so making changes to it was going to prove challenging. I put my ""Product Manager"" hat on and asked what their goals were with this application, the logic, measuring success, etc. I was asked to start a rewrite so that the laundry list of changes they had wanted to make could be done. It was also at this time my boss was super happy with the ideas/work I had done (I had several other smaller projects I did during this time), so they began speaking to me about being promoted up. How we'd get an actual software engineer on my team so I could focus on more of the ""Data Science"" stuff. I was super excited/anxious because I was hoping to get more hands-on DS experience before leading a team. However, once again, I come from startups so sort of par for the course.



**Year 2** 

The IT department announces a ""reorg"" a month before my promotion. By this point I had job descriptions for a few new positions, and we had made plans for who would be shifting to my team. All of this gets put on hold, and there's tons of uncertainty. I spend the next year doing the rewrite by myself. I build a few classification models in the process to help a few other internal teams operate more efficiently.

Basically they come through with a domain-driven design philosophy so that the Software teams can build more efficiently by having more autonomy. They establish practices across the domains, and they had a Data/ML practice initially. That gave me some confidence that I'd at least have ""peers"" when it was all said and done.



**Year 3 – Current year** 

I get moved into a domain, and they establish a separate BI & Analytics domain. They decentralized everything else but anything to do with ""Data Work"". I am given a promotion to DS Manager with a single employee – a Data Engineer. It has been super confusing all year with things taking much longer as the org adjusts for the new bureaucratic processes that have been introduced – tooling now has to be approved, Business analyst, delivery leads, PMO offices, etc. I meet with the head of engineering to ask how I go about getting tools approved (Sage Maker endpoints), and to get a sense of our overall data strategy. I'm basically told there isn't one in place, but they hope to get one together soonish. A lot has happened and it all feels very confusing. Basically no one is empowered to make decisions, the BI domain is leading the charge for their stuff, and me and my team are sort of this island that exists outside of everything else going on.



I tried to keep that as short as possible, and happy to give further detail if you believe it'd help.



**Here's my main issue:** I spent these years doing what needed to be done, but there really isn't a path of ""growth"" because they aren't really accounting for Data Scientists yet – though they say they hope to hire them. It was clear in the first year what the path would probably look like, but with everything becoming more corporate it feels like I could easily get shafted in one way or another. However, because I spent these years being the ""good employee"" and doing what needed to be done instead of what was best for my own experience I think it may be hard for me to get a DS job at another org. I'm hoping to get some perspective from all of you more seasoned professionals.",variab1e_J,t2_rjstc4sx,1735518438.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hpaa3c/looking_for_some_senior_ds_advice/,15,0.82,13,public

Would knowing the winning chances for specific hands change how you approach the game?
Could this kind of information improve strategy, or would it take away from the fun of figuring it out on the fly?
What other scenarios or patterns would you find valuable to analyze?

Since I have the actual post-implementation usage, now I can use it to find the cumulative difference/residual.

But my question is, since the model is trained on the pre-implementation data doesn't it make sense for the residual error to be high against the counter factual?

The data points in pre-implementation are mostly even across the lower and higher boundary and Its clear that there are more data points in the lower boundaries in the post-implementation but not sure how I would correctly test this.

Regression on multiple independent variable,Regression on multiple independent variable,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hmuob8/regression_on_multiple_independent_variable/,"Hello everyone,

I've come across a use case that's got me stumped, and I'd like your opinion.

I have around 1 million pieces of data representing the profit of various projects over a period of time. Each project has its ID, its profits at the date, the date, and a few other independent variables such as the project manager, city, etc...

So I have projects over years, with monthly granularity. Several projects can be running simultaneously.

I'd like to be able to predict a project's performance at a specific date. (based on profits)

The problem I've encountered is that each project only lasts 1 year on average, which means we have 12 data points per project, so it's impossible to do LSTM per project. As far as I know, you can't generalise LSTM for a case like mine (similar periods of time for different projects).

How do you build a model that could generalise the prediction of the benefits of a project over its lifecycle?

What I've done for the moment is classic regression (xgboost, decision tree) with variables such as the age of the project (in months), the date, the benefits over M-1, M-6, M-12. I've chosen 1 or 0 as the target variable (positive or negative margin at the current month).

I'm afraid that regression won't be enough to capture more complex trends (lagged trend especially). Which kind of model would you advise me to go ? Am I on a good direction ?",Daamm1,t2_66du5vz4,1735238072.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hmuob8/regression_on_multiple_independent_variable/,30,1.0,17,public
Puppy: organize your 2025 python projects,Puppy: organize your 2025 python projects,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hng96m/puppy_organize_your_2025_python_projects/,"# TLDR

[https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy) is a transparent wrapper around pixi and uv, with simple APIs and recipes for using them to help write reproducible, future-proof scripts and notebooks.

## From 0 to rich toolset in one command:

Start in an empty folder.

```
curl -fsSL ""https://pup-py-fetch.hf.space?python=3.12&pixi=jupyter&env1=duckdb,pandas"" | bash
```

installs python and dependencies, in complete isolation from any existing python on your system.  Mix and match URL [query params](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy?tab=readme-ov-file#one-installer-to-rule-them-all) to specify python version, tools, and venvs to create.

The above also installs puppy's CLI (`pup --help`):

## CLI - kind of like ""uv-lite""
- `pup add myenv pkg1 pkg2` (install packages to ""myenv"" folder using uv)
- `pup list` view what's installed across all projects
- `pup clone` and `pup sync` clone and build external repos (must have buildable `pyproject.toml` files)

## Pup as a Module - no more notebook kernels

The original motivation for writing puppy was to simplify handling kernels, but you might just not need them at all.  Activate/create/modify ""kernels"" interactively with:

```
import pup
pup.fetch(""myenv"")  # ""activate"" - packages in ""myenv"" are now importable
pup.fetch(""myenv"", ""pkg1"", ""pkg2"")  # ""install and activate"" - equivalent to `pup add myenv pkg1 pkg2`  
```

Of course you're welcome to use `!uv pip install`, but after 10 times it's liable to get messy.


## Target Audience

Loosely defining 2 personas:

1. Getting Started with Python (or herding folks who are):
   1. puppy is the easiest way to go from 0 to modern python - one-command installer that lets you specify python version, venvs to build, repos to clone - getting everyone from 0 to 1 in an easy and standardized way
   2. if you're confused about virtual environments and notebook kernels and install full jupyter into every project

2. Competent - check out [Multi-Puppy-Verse](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy?tab=readme-ov-file#multi-puppy-verse) and [Where Pixi Shines](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy?tab=readme-ov-file#where-pixi-shines-) sections:
   1. you have 10 work and hobby projects going at the same time and need a better way to organize them for packaging, deployment, or even to find stuff 6 months later
   2. you need support for conda and non-python stuff - you have many fast-moving external and internal dependencies - check out `pup clone` and `pup sync` workflows and [dockerized examples](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/tree/main/examples)


## Filesystem is your friend

Puppy recommends a sensible folder structure where each outer folder houses one and only one python executable - in isolation from each other and any other python on your system. Pup is tied to a python executable that is installed by Pixi, along with project-level tools like Jupyter, conda packages, and non-python tools (NodeJS, make, etc.) Puppy commands work the same from anywhere within this folder.

The inner folders are git-ready projects, defined by pyproject.toml, with project-specific packages handled by uv.



```
# ├── puphome/  # python 3.12 lives here
# │   ├── public-project/
# │   │   ├── .git  # this folder may be a git repo (see pup clone)
# │   │   ├── .venv
# │   │   └── pyproject.toml
# │   ├── env2/
# │   │   ├── .venv/  # this one is in pre-git development
# │   │   └── pyproject.toml
# │   ├── pixi.toml
# │   └── pup.py
# ├── pup311torch/  # python 3.11 here
# │   ├── env3/
# │   ├── env4/
# │   ├── pixi.toml
# │   └── pup.py
# └── pup313beta/  # 3.13 here
#     ├── env5/
#     ├── pixi.toml
#     └── pup.py
```

Puppy embraces ""explicit is better than implicit"" from the Zen of python; it logs what it's doing, with absolute paths, so that you always know where you are and how you got there.



PS I've benefited a great deal from the many people's OSS work - now trying to pay it forward. The ideas laid out in puppy's README and implementation have come together after many years of working in different orgs, where average ""how do you rate yourself in python"" ranged from zero (Excel 4ever) to highly sophisticated. The matter of ""how do we build stuff"" is kind of never settled, and this is my take.

However, I felt like the amount of work and the nature of work just wasn't a match for me, it felt like manual labour, except with my brain.

So, I’m trying to get some hands-on experience in machine learning and data science—not just the “do more projects” advice (I’ve already done a bunch), but actual real-world stuff where I can work on meaningful problems.

I recently applied for an Omdena project, and I’m wondering if anyone here has done something with them? What’s it like? Did it actually help you gain valuable experience, or was it just another “group project” kind of thing?

Also, are there other platforms or places where I could jump into something similar? I’m trying to avoid the whole “chasing certifications” rabbit hole. I just want to get better at solving real problems, not stacking credentials.

"You Get a Dataset and Need to Find a ""Good"" Model Quickly (in Hours or Days), what's your strategy?","You Get a Dataset and Need to Find a ""Good"" Model Quickly (in Hours or Days), what's your strategy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk7uvs/you_get_a_dataset_and_need_to_find_a_good_model/,"**Typical Scenario**: Your friend gives you a dataset and challenges you to beat their model's performance. They don't tell you what they did, but they provide a single CSV file and the performance metric to optimize.

Assumptions:
- Almost always tabular data, so no need learning needed.
- The dataset is typically small-ish (<100k rows, <100 columns), so it fits into memory.
- It's always some kind of classification/regression, sometimes time series forecasting.
- The data is generally ready for modeling (minimal cleaning needed).
- Single data metric to optimize (if they don't have one, I force them to pick one and only one).
- No additional data is available.
- You have 1-2 days to do your best.
- Maybe there's a hold out test set, or maybe you're optimizing repeated k-fold cross-validation.

I've been in this situation perhaps a few dozen times over the years. Typically it's friends of friends, typically it's a work prototype or a grad student project, sometimes it's paid work. Always I feel like my honor is on the line so I go hard and don't sleep for 2 days. Have you been there?

Here's how I typically approach it:

1. **Establish a Test Harness:** If there's a hold out test set, I do a train/test split sensitivity analysis and find a ratio that preserves data/performance distributions (high correlation, no statistical difference in means). If there's no holdout set, I ask them to evaluate their model (if they have one) using 3x10-fold cv and save the result. Sometimes I want to know their result, sometimes not. Having a target to beat is very motivating!
2. **Establish a Baseline:** Start with dummy models get a baseline performance. Anything above this has skill.
3. **Spot Checking:** Run a suite of all scikit-learn models with default configs and default ""sensible"" data prep pipelines.
	- Repeat with  asuite (grid) of standard configs for all models.
	- Spot check more advanced models in third party libs like GBM libs (xgboost, catboost, lightgbm), superlearner, imbalanced learn if needed, etc.
	- I want to know what the performance frontier looks like within a few hours and what looks good out of the box.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Focus on models that perform well and use grid search or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. I setup background grid/random searches to run when I have nothing else going on. I'll try some bayes opt/some tpot/auto sklearn, etc. to see if anything interesting surfaces.
5. **Pipeline Optimization:** Experiment with data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines. Sometimes you find that a lesser used transform for an unlikely model surfaces something interesting.
6. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine top-performing models using stacking/voting/averaging. I schedule this to run every 30 min and to try look for diverse models in the result set, ensemble them together and try and squeeze out some more performance.
7. **Iterate Until Time Runs Out:** Keep refining and experimenting based on the results. There should always be some kind of hyperparameter/pipeline/ensemble optimization running as background tasks. Foreground is for wild ideas I dream up. Perhaps a 50/50 split of cores, or 30/70 or 20/80 if I'm onto something and need more compute.

Not a ton of time for EDA/feature engineering. I might circle back after we have the performance frontier mapped and the optimizers are grinding. Things are calmer, I have ""something"" to show by then and can burn a few hours on creating clever features.

I dump all configs + results into an sqlite db and have a flask CRUD app that allows me to search/summarize the performance frontier. I don't use tools like mlflow and friends because they didn't really exist when I started doing this a decade ago. Maybe it's time to switch things up. Also, they don't do the ""continuous optimization"" thing I need as far as I know.

I re-hack my scripts for each project. They're a mess. Oh well. I often dream of turning this into an ""auto ml like service"", just to make my life easier in the future :)

What is (or would be) your strategy in this situation? How do you maximize results in such a short timeframe?

Would you do anything differently or in a different order?

Where is the distinction? Can someone be both? At large companies does it matter?

ML pipeline questions,ML pipeline questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/,"I am building an application that processes videos and that needs to run many tasks (some need to be sequentially and some in parallel). Think audio extraction, ASR, diarization, translation, video classification, etc... Note that this is in supposed to be run online, i.e. this is supposed to be used in a web app where the user uploads a video and this pipeline I just described is run, the output is either stores in a bucket or a database and the results are shown after some time.

When I look up ""ML pipelines"" on goole I get stuff like kubeflow pipelines or vertex ai pipelines, so here is my first question:

1. Are these pipeline tools supposed to be run in production/online like in the use case I just described or are they meant to build ML pipelines for model training (preprocessing data, training a model and building a docker with the model weights, example) that are scheduled every so often? 

  
It feels like these tools are not what I want because they seem to be aimed at building models and not serving them.



After some googling I realized one good option would be to use Ray with Kubernetes. They allow for model composition and allow for node configuration for each task which is exactly what I was looking for, but my second question is: 

2. What else could I use for this task?

Plain kubernetes seems to be another option but more complex at setting up... it seems weird to me that there are no more tools for this purpose (multi model serving with different hardware requirements), unless I can do this with kubeflow or vertex ai pipelines",AdministrativeRub484,t2_h916gqd1,1734884282.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/,10,0.86,10,public

It’s a valid concern, and the dangers are real. But let me tell you, there’s another side of the coin that had me saying, “Holy bleep.”

This year, I joined a project where the team is dominated by statisticians and economists. Sounds like a data science dream team, right? Not so fast. It feels like I hopped into a time machine and landed in the 90s. Git? Never heard of it. Instead, we’ve got the old-school hierarchy of script_v1, script_final_version_1, script_final_version_2, all the way to script_final_version_n. It's a wild ride.

Code reviews? Absolutely nonexistent. Every script is its own handcrafted masterpiece, riddled with what I can only describe as ""surprise features"" in the preprocessing pipeline. Bugs aren’t bugs, apparently. “If you just pay close attention and read your code twice, you’ll see there’s no issue,” they tell me. Uh, sure. I don’t trust a single output right now because I know that behind every analysis bugs are having the party of their lives.

 Doctorate in quantitative marketing / marketing worth it? , Doctorate in quantitative marketing / marketing worth it? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hjc9e0/doctorate_in_quantitative_marketing_marketing/,"I’ll be graduating with my MS stats in the spring and then working as a data scientist within the ad tech / retail / marketing space. My current Ms thesis, despite it being statistics (causal inference) focused it’s rooted in applications within business, and my advisors are stats/marketing folks in the business school.

After my first year of graduate school I immediately knew a PhD n statistics would not be for me. That degree is really for me not as interesting as I’m not obsessive about knowing the inner details and theory behind statistics and want to create more theory. I’m motivated towards applications in business, marketing, and “data science” settings. 

Topics of interest of mine have been how statistical methods have been used in the marketing space and its intersection with modern machine learning.

I decided that I’d take a job as a data scientist post graduation to build some experience and frankly make some money.

A few things I’ve thought about regarding my career trajectory:

1. Build a niche skillset as a data scientist within the industry within marketing/experimentation and try and get to a staff DS in FAANG experimentation type roles

- a lot of my masters thesis literature review was on topics like causal inference and online experimentation. These types of roles in industry would be something I’d like to work in 


2. After 3-4 yo experience in my current marketing DS role, go back to academia at a top tier business school and do a PhD in quantitative marketing or marketing with a focus on publishing research regarding statistical methods for marketing applications

- I’ve read through a lot of the research focus of a lot of different quant marketing PhD programs and they seem to align with my interests. My current Ms thesis in ways to estimate CATE functions and heterogenous treatment effect, and these are generally of interest in marketing PhD programs

- I’ve always thought working in an academic setting would give me more freedom to work on problems that interest me, rather than be limited to the scope of industry. If I were to go this route I’d try and make tenure at an R1 business school.


I’d like to hear your thoughts on both of these pathways, and weigh in on:

1. Which of these sounds better, given my goals?

2. Which is the most practical?

3. For anyone whose done a PhD in quantitative marketing and or PhD in marketing with an emphasis in quantitative methods, what that was like and if it’s worth doing especially if I got into a top business school.

Hi everyone! I’m working on analyzing a dataset (600,000 rows) containing geospatial and soil measurements collected along a stretch of land. 

The data includes the following fields:

Latitude & Longitude: Geospatial coordinates for each measurement.

Height: Elevation at the measurement point.

Slope: Slope of the land at the point.

Soil Height to Baseline: The difference in soil height relative to a baseline.

Repeated Measurements: Some locations have multiple measurements over time, allowing for variance analysis.

Currently, the data points seem disconnected (not linked by any obvious structure like a continuous line or relationships between points). My challenge is that I believe I need to connect or group this data in some way to perform more meaningful analyses, such as tracking changes over time or identifying spatial trend. 

Aside from my ideas, do you have any thoughts for how this could be a useful dataset? What analysis can be done? ",Proof_Wrap_2150,t2_5m5g3zg6,1734724937.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hisd3a/advice_on_analyzing_geospatial_soil_dataset_how/,14,0.95,20,public

I'm a working data scientist and I want to study Operations Research and Statistical Modeling, with a focus on chemical manufacturing. 

I’m looking for learning resources that include applied examples as part of the learning path. Alternatively, a simple, beginner-friendly use case (with a solution pathway) would work as well - I can always pick up the theory on my own (in fact, most of what I found was theory without any practice examples - or several months long courses with way too many other topics included).

I'm limited in the time I can spend, so each topic should fit into a half-day (max. 1 day) of learning. The goal here is not to become an expert but to get a foundational skill-level where I can confidently find and conduct use cases without too much external handholding. Upskilling for the future senior title, basically. 😄

Topics are:

 - Linear Programming (LP): e.g. Resource allocation, cost minimization.

 - Integer Programming (IP): e.g. Scheduling, batch production.

- Bayesian Statistics
    
- Monte Carlo Simulation: e.g. Risk and uncertainty analysis.
    
- Stochastic Optimization: Decision-making under uncertainty.
    
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): Sequential decision-making (e.g., maintenance strategies).

- Time Series Analysis: e.g. forecasting demand for chemical products.

- Game Theory: e.g. Pricing strategies, competitive dynamics.

Examples or datasets related to chemical production or operations are a plus, but not strictly necessary.

Only reason why I'm hesitant is that I've been focusing on LLM work for a while and it doesn't seem like that's what the Fraud space does.

To sum it up:

1. Is there a ton of red tape/compliance/MRM work with Fraud models?
2. With an increase of Fraud losses every year, is this an area that'll be a hot commodity/good to get experience with?
3. Can you really do LLM work in this space? The VP I interviewed with said that the space was going to do GenAI in a few years, but when I asked him questions on what that meant to him, he had no clue but wanted to get into it

"Sales Forecasting for optimizing resource allocation (minimize waste, maximize sales)","Sales Forecasting for optimizing resource allocation (minimize waste, maximize sales)",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hgllx0/sales_forecasting_for_optimizing_resource/,"Hi All,

To break up the monotony of ""muh job market bad"" (I sympathize don't worry), I wanted to get some input from people here about a problem we come across a lot where I work.  Curious what some advice would be.

So I work for a client that has lots of transactions of low value.  We have TONS of data going back more than a decade for the client and we've recenlty solved some major organizational challenges which means we can do some really interesting stuff with it.

They really want to improve their forecasting but one challenge I noted was that the data we would be training our algorithms on is affected by their attempts to control and optimize, which were often based on voodoo.  Their stock becomes waste pretty quickly if its not distributed properly.  So the data doesn't really reflect how much profit could have been made, because of the clients own attempts to optimize their profits.  Demand is being estimated poorly in other words so the actual sales are of questionable value for training if I were to just use mean squared error, median squared error, because just matching the dynamics of previous sales cycles does not actually optimize the problem.

I have a couple solutions to this and I want the communities opinion.

  
**1) Build a novel optimization algorithm that incorporates waste as a penalty.**    
I am wondering if this already exists somewhere, or 

  
**2) Smooth the data temporally enough and maximize on profit not sales.**

Rather than optimizing on sales daily, we could for instance predict week by week, this would be a more reasonable approach because stock has to be sent out on a particular day in anticipation of being sold.  

  
**3) Use reinforcement learning here, or generative adversarial networks.**

I was thinking of having a network trained to minimize waste, and another designed to maximize sales and have them ""compete"" in a game to find the best actions.  Minimizing waste would involve making it negative.

  
**4) Should I cluster the stores beforehand and train models to predict based on the subclusters, this could weed out bias in the data.**

I was considering that for store-level predictions it may be useful to have an unbiased sample.  This would mean training on data that has been down sampled or up-sampled to for certain outlet types 

  
**Lastly any advice on particular ML approaches would be helpful, was currently considering MAMBA for this as it seems to be fairly computationally efficient and highly accurate.  Explain ability is not really a concern for this task.**

**I look forward to your thoughts a criticism, please share resources (papers, videos, etc) that may be relevant.**

For each patient, I have baseline risk scores (well-calibrated), interventions (binary), patient characteristics (demographics, diagnoses), prior healthcare utilization, care team members, and outcomes captured in the 6 months post-enrollment. Roughly 20-30% are generally considered high risk.

My current approach involves fitting a logistic regression model using baseline risk scores, enrollment channel, patient characteristics, and interventions as independent variables. My outcome is hospitalization (binary 0/1). I know that baseline risk and enrollment channel have significant influence on the outcome, so I’ve baked in many interaction terms involving these. My main effects and interaction effects are all over the map, showing little consistency and very few coefficients that indicate positive impact on risk reduction. 

I’m a bit outside of my comfort zone. Any suggestions on how to fine-tune my logistic regression model, or pursue a different approach?",dmorris87,t2_1q6oq5dl,1734481000.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hgozqm/asking_for_help_solving_a_work_problem_population/,5,0.69,6,public

Fine-tuning & synthetic data example: creating 9 fine tuned models from scratch in 18 minutes,Fine-tuning & synthetic data example: creating 9 fine tuned models from scratch in 18 minutes,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hfk7ah/finetuning_synthetic_data_example_creating_9_fine/,"**TL;DR:** I built [Kiln](https://getkiln.ai), a new free tool that makes fine-tuning LLMs easy. In this example, I create 9 fine-tuned models (including Llama 3.x, Mixtral, and GPT-4o-mini) in just 18 minutes for less than $6 total cost. This is completely from scratch, and includes task definition, synthetic dataset generation, and model deployment.

The codebase is all on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln).

# Walkthrough

For the example I created 9 models in 18 minutes of work (not including waiting for training/data-gen). There's a walkthrough of each step in the [fine-tuning guide](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/blob/main/guides/Fine%20Tuning%20LLM%20Models%20Guide.md), but the summary is:

* \[2 mins\]: Define task, goals, and schema
* \[9 mins\]: Synthetic data generation: create 920 high-quality examples using topic trees, large models, chain of thought, and interactive UI
* \[5 mins\]: dispatch 9 fine tuning jobs: Fireworks (Llama 3.2 1b/3b/11b, Llama 3.1 8b/70b, Mixtral 8x7b), OpenAI (GPT 4o-mini & 4o), and Unsloth (Llama 3.2 1b/3b)
* \[2 mins\]: deploy models and test they work

# Results

The result was small models that worked quite well, when the base models previously failed to produce the correct style and structure. The overall cost was less than $6 (excluding GPT 4o, which was $16, and probably wasn’t necessary). The smallest model (Llama 3.2 1B) is about 10x faster and 150x cheaper than the models we used during synthetic data generation. 

# Guide

I wrote a [detailed fine-tuning guide](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/blob/main/guides/Fine%20Tuning%20LLM%20Models%20Guide.md), covering more details around deployment, running fully locally with Unsloth/Ollama, exporting to GGUF, data strategies, and next steps like evals.

# Feedback Please!

I’d love feedback on the tooling, UX and idea! And any suggestions for what to add next (RAG? More models? Images? Eval tools?). Feel free to DM if you have any questions.

I'm starting to work on the evals portion of the tool so if folks have requests I'm eager to hear it.

# Try it!

What’s the point of testing machine learning model knowledge during interviews for non-research data science roles?,What’s the point of testing machine learning model knowledge during interviews for non-research data science roles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hewiu9/whats_the_point_of_testing_machine_learning_model/,"I always make an effort to learn how a model works and how it differs from other similar models whenever I encounter a new model. So it felt natural to me that these topics were brought up in interviews.

However, someone recently asked me a question that I hadn’t given much thought to before: what’s the point of testing machine learning model knowledge during interviews for non-research data science roles?

Interview questions about model knowledge often include the following, especially if a candidate claims to have experience with these models:-

* what's the difference between bagging and boosting? 
* whether LightGBM uses leaf-wise splitting or level-wise splitting?
* what's the underlying assumptions of linear regression?

I learned these concepts because I’m genuinely interested in understanding how models work. But, coming back to the question: How important is it to have deep technical knowledge of machine learning models for someone who isn’t in a research position and primarily uses these tools to solve business problems?

From my experience, knowing how models learn from data has occasionally helped me identify issues during the model training process more quickly. But I couldn’t come up with a convincing argument to justify why it is fair to test this knowledge, other than “the candidate should know it if they are using it.”

What’s your experience with this topic? Do you think understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical enough to be tested during interviews?",orz-_-orz,t2_p5ev9e4y,1734281055.0,/r/datascience/comments/1hewiu9/whats_the_point_of_testing_machine_learning_model/,36,0.82,30,public

I've learned a reliable process for writing, but I haven't mastered one for graphics. I'd love to hear what other people are doing. Some rudiments of a process:

- Start with cheap exploratory viz to find your story.
- Outline and revise your explanatory graphics by hand-- seems faster.
- Draft the ""data ink"" completely before tweaking aesthetics.
- Draft 80%-polished versions of graphs before the day you need them.
- Ruthlessly cut and consolidate graphics to the essentials.
- Forego graphics when narrative or tables are equally effective.
- Accept that a given chart typically takes X hours and plan accordingly.

Our goal is to help data scientists use scikit-learn more effectively, provide the necessary tooling to track metrics and models, and visualize them effectively. Right now, it mostly includes support for model validation. We plan to extend the features to more phases of the ML workflow, such as model analysis and selection.

They asked if I could develop a proof of concept (POC) to present to our board of directors. The company had previously attempted to work with three external teams, but none of those efforts were successful. I presented the POC, and it went exceptionally well. We secured funding and created a junior data science position specifically for me. Previously, the company had no such role or anything similar. While the IT team is very strong, they haven’t had the capacity to handle initiatives like this.



Since then, I’ve been obsessed—reading everything I can and taking stats classes for a certificate program at MIT (with plans to continue my education). I’m pretty sure I’ve been driving my wife and friends crazy because I love talking about this stuff. I’m genuinely passionate about it!



That said, I still have so much to learn and need to overcome my imposter syndrome. On top of this fast-moving environment, I’ve never worked in IT before, never used Jira, or been involved in their overall processes, so I’m navigating that learning curve too. I’d love to connect with others here, hear your stories, and get more involved in this r/datascience community!

Error rates /dirty data can cause sickness? ,Error rates /dirty data can cause sickness? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hcb1gc/error_rates_dirty_data_can_cause_sickness/,"I do remember reading a long time ago that in production lines with high error-rates the motivation of labourers went down and the stress affected the workforce.

I wonder if dirty-data can have the same effect and has been researched as such. I know there are studies into error-rates in software, but that mixes software with data.

I wonder if specifically the stress caused by the unpredictability of the amount of work and the constant pressure dirty data causes has been studied as a health concern/risk.

I juggle tasks like automating deployments, managing Kubernetes clusters in AWS, and scripting in Python and Bash, manage and analyze SQL databases, working with APIs, etc.  
  
**What I like**  
- I get paid well  & have skillsets that makes it more difficult for companies to replace you  
- I need to learn and stay up to date on a variety of technologies (I consider this a plus since you're never really 'out of date' on your role)     
- I enjoy makes graphs and gathering statistics/data to help our team  
- I enjoy interpreting that data to determine the root cause of an issue  
- In terms of scripting, I like making quick and dirty scripts that help my team automate something for us (this doesn't including writing large complicated scripts for other teams)   

    

**Why I hate it and want to leave**  
- The job, by its very nature, means everything is always urgent  
- On call, so a consistent 9-5 is not possible. You're often staying past your shift  
- Have to constantly work with devs and other parties to ensure their services or code gets fixed  
- Rarely any slow days, you're either automating a new large project or jumping on an urgent issue   
 
 
So based on the above, I'm curious if transitioning to a Data Science type role would offer a more laid-back environment, the question is I don't know what. Anyone made this switch or have insights?

I think not talking about this from a data science perspective is an ethics violation because we as practitioners can make the decision to not engage or pursue a project just because “I have a boss and they told me I need to because it aligns with our strategy.” I personally have quit a job in the past because the ethics of the CV models we were creating dawned on me and didn’t make me feel right. Sure I could validate it by saying I was only creating a small part of the software system, the reality is I knew the end goal and was actively participating in the development of a system that could be used for an ethically questionable use case. 

The possibility of UHCs actuarial science, analysts, and Data Scientists developing models to contribute to the strategy of increased profits and increased denials should be questioned. And I know “denial rates” aren’t apples to apples as back office rev cycle management people could wrongfully code a claim which can cause it to be denied. I’m talking more from a targeted perspective. Actuaries that work in insurance are very smart, but I want to get some insight about the specifics of what goes on from a health insurance perspective when they are denying a claim.

I am currently studying the bachelor Econometrics in The Netherlands and next year I will need to choose a master to pursue. My main doubt is, as you can see from the title, between data science (which is a bit outside my bachelor) and quantitative finance. 

On the one hand I may be a bit more interested in data science, but on the other hand I have the feeling that I will ‘throw away’ my Econometrics bachelor that is quite unique. From my point of view data science is followed by many people, also people from lower wage countries, while quantitative finance is a master that not many people follow.

It’s now time to choose the classification threshold. This will clearly depend on the use case and the cost/ benefits associated with true positives, false positives, etc. 

Often I see people advising to choose a threshold by looking at metrics such precision and recall. 

What I don’t see very often is people explicitly defining relative (or absolute, if possible) costs/ benefits of each cell in the confusion matrix (or more precisely the action that will be taken as a result). For example a true positive is worth $1000, a false positive -$500 and the other cells $0. 

You then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a cost-threshold curve. The precision and recall can also be reported, but they are secondary to the benefit optimisation and not used directly in the choice. I find this much more intuitive and is my go-to.
