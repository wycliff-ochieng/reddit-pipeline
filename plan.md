That's an exciting project! Here's how you can approach it step by step while honing your data engineering skills:

1. Define Your Project Scope
Goal: Decide the objective (e.g., analyze subreddit trends, sentiment analysis, user activity patterns).
Data: Determine what data you need (posts, comments, user metadata).
2. Set Up Reddit API Integration
Use the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library to fetch data.
Practice API authentication and pagination to handle large datasets.
3. Data Ingestion (Real-Time & Batch)
Real-Time: Use Kafka for streaming Reddit data into your pipeline.
Batch: Set up a scheduled Python script to fetch data periodically.
4. Data Storage
Use PostgreSQL to store raw and processed data.
Design a relational schema to optimize querying.
5. Data Processing
Spark: Perform transformations like cleaning, deduplication, or sentiment analysis.
Practice using Spark's RDDs, DataFrames, and SQL for different tasks.
6. Data Modeling
Apply dimensional modeling (e.g., Star Schema) for analytics-ready data.
Create fact and dimension tables for subreddits, users, and posts.
7. Containerization
Use Docker to containerize your API script, Spark jobs, and database.
Learn to orchestrate with Docker Compose.
8. Analytics
Use SQL to perform queries and generate insights.
Optionally connect to a BI tool like Tableau or Power BI for visualization.
9. Scaling & Automation
Automate your pipeline using tools like Airflow or Prefect.
Explore how to scale using distributed Kafka and Spark clusters.
10. Documentation & Deployment
Document the pipeline and create a README for your repository.
Deploy using cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).

Got it! Here's a detailed project architecture including the tools you mentioned:

Reddit Data Pipeline Architecture
1. Data Ingestion
Reddit API Integration: Use PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for fetching data.
Real-Time Streaming: Use Kafka for ingesting real-time data from Reddit.
Batch Processing: Schedule a Python script using EC2 to fetch data in batches.
2. Data Storage (Raw Data)
Amazon S3: Store raw data (posts and comments) as JSON or Parquet files. S3 is scalable and cost-effective for raw data storage.
PostgreSQL on EC2: Optionally store raw data for quick access during development.
3. Data Processing
Apache Spark (on EMR or ECS):
Clean and transform data.
Perform deduplication and enrichment (e.g., sentiment analysis).
Store intermediate transformed data back into S3.
4. Data Modeling & Storage (Analytics Ready)
Amazon Redshift:
Load transformed data into Redshift for analytics.
Design a Star Schema with fact tables (e.g., posts, comments) and dimension tables (e.g., users, subreddits).
Use AWS Glue for ETL jobs to load data into Redshift from S3.
5. Analytics & Querying
Use SQL in Redshift to perform complex queries.
Optionally connect Redshift to a BI tool like Tableau for dashboards.
6. Orchestration & Automation
Use Airflow or Prefect for scheduling and monitoring pipeline tasks.
Host the orchestrator on EC2 or as a containerized service on ECS.
7. Deployment & Monitoring
Use Docker to containerize your scripts (API, Kafka producer, Spark jobs).
Deploy containers on ECS.
Monitor pipeline health using AWS CloudWatch.
